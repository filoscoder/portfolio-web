## About me

I was born in South Korea, raised in Argentina, and worked in many countries like Argentina, United States, Mexico, and South Korea as well. I worked in Accounting and Finance fields in the past, this experience gives me a new perspective looking at the details and forecasting limited resources, this also allows great improvements in logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Now I'm into web development, working as a software engineer I'm always open to develop on both, client and the server-side. My highest goal is to make the world a better place through tech. Never forget this, tech is always a tool and not a purpose by itself. I always think coding should be altruistic.

I currently work and live in Madrid, Spain with my lovely wife Amanda.

I'm skilled in Javascript environment focused on the client-side but always supporting everybody's "back"(end). Interested in handling cross-platform cool ideas & developing real-world problem solutions. I'm always aware of the existence of a variated pool of skills that makes me humble & listen-first-minded. I also have strong logical communication skills and a problem-solving attitude.

I speaks Spanish and Korean native level, and enough English to be a valuable contributor :)
